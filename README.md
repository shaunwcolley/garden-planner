Live link: https://squarefootgarden.herokuapp.com/

The Square Foot Garden Planner (SFGP) is a garden planner that allows user to create a garden plan with drag and drop and allows for the persistance of the plan over time. Additional features include a calendar of expected harvests and updating profile information.

## Why?

After looking for a free decent garden planner I noticed one thing was missing: ability to persist plans over time based on expected harvest dates. Square foot plots in gardens change over time while others can remain the same for months longer. I needed a way to capture this fact when planning my community garden plot. Thus, the SFGP was born. SFGP is a relatively bare bones app that captures the spirit of this feature.

Users are able to create a new plan for a 12 inch planter or as large as is needed.

## Future Plans

Feel free to suggest future features. Current ideas for features include: viewing garden across time from first planting to future iterations, implementing a companion/foe system, a resources page for square foot garden techniques and facts, a plant spacing system, implementing a grow region recommended planting.
